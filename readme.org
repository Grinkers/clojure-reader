* clojure-reader

** A crate to read Clojure.

*** EDN [[https://github.com/edn-format/edn][(Extensible Data Notation)]]

**** Differences from `clojure.tools.reader/edn`

     1. Strings are not escaped
     2. Tags are currently unimplemented

** MSRV (minimal supported rust version) is stable minus 2 versions. Once stable (1.0.0), the plan is to indefinitely maintain the MSRV.

* Default Features

  The following features are enabled by default. To disable use this crate without default features.

** std

   When using no_std, this crate relies on `alloc`. You must supply your own `#[global_allocator]`.

** floats

   Pulls in the dependency `ordered-float` for Edn::Double. Without this feature, parsing floating-point numbers will result in an Err.
